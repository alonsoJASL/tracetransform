This is a C++ implementation of the Trace Transform algorithm, with support for
orthonormal circus functionals. Relevant papers are:
 * A. Kadyrov and M. Petrou, The trace transform and its applications
 * M. Petrou and A. Kadyrov, Affine invariant features from the trace transform
 * A. Frías-Velézquez et al., Object identification by using orthonormal circus
   functions from the trace transform

This implementation features CUDA kernels to alleviate most of the compute-heavy
parts of the algorithm to the GPU. There are some restrictions though:
 * The implementation of scan() is pretty naive, and uses a separate thread for
   each row of the padded image. This means that big images require big GPUs.
 * SVD is pretty complex, so we use CULA's sgesvd implementation.


How to build
------------

Requirements are:
 * C/C++ compiler (tested: GCC >= 4.6)
 * Eigen 3
 * Boost (tested: >= 1.52)
 * CMake >= 2.8.7
 * CULA Dense (tested: R17)

The basic procedure to build this port is as following:
 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build
 $ cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
 $ make

Note however, that depending on which CULA version you use you might need to
link against an older CUDA toolkit. To do so, point CMake towards the toolkit
root using -DCUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT. Also note that some of these older versions
might impose restrictions on which host compiler to use with nvcc, which you
can change using -DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER.

Some additional notes:
 * In order to use a different compiler, specify -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER and
   -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER. To change the host compiler nvcc uses, specify
   -DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER.
 * If you want debugging symbols, use -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
 * If you want to make use of MKL, define MKLROOT and re-configure the project.
   In order to get a functional binary, you might want to bake the MKL library
   paths, reported by CMake as LD_LIBRARY_PATH, into your final binary using
   -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="-Wl,-rpath=${LIBRARY_PATH}"
