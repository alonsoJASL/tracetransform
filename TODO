* Improve use of Image.jl
  - generic implementations of algorithms (in terms of AbstractAyyay{T}),
    given that they do not degrade performance too much
  - use scale/convert stuff https://github.com/timholy/Images.jl/blob/master/doc/function_reference.md
* Revert 'unrolled' matrix multiplication as soon as Julia can handle
  these small-matrix multiplications
