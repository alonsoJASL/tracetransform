Requirements
------------

* GCC >= 4.6 or Clang >= 3.1

Main development happens using Clang 3.1 (older versions might be supported, but
this is untested), and compatibility with GCC 4.6 is ensured.


* OpenCV > 2.4

Since 2.4 isn't out yet (as of 20121119), you'll need to use the Git version;
this because of a bug in the latest release.


* Eigen 3
